      You can apply at any time, but we recommend that you apply by 1 August for September course 
      start (or at least 6 weeks before any other start date). 
      This is important in particular if you need Tier 4 visa to study in the 
      UK as you need to allow enough time to complete your visa application process. 
      This usually takes 3-4 weeks.

      If you would like to defer the start of your course, you need to email pgadmissions@hull.ac.uk. 
      The Postgraduate Admissions team will then contact the academic department for approval.
      Deferrals are normally only allowed if requested up to six weeks after the initial start date. 
      After this, you may need to apply again.
